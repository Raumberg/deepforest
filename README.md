# Deep Forest
Is a Neural-based shallow forest structure implemented with Jax (Accelerated linear algebra), Flax (NN core on top of Jax) and Optax (Optimizational core library on top of Jax). Deep forest is trying to be adapted from various publications of authors in arxiv.org
### Note:
This is not a universal algorithm (at least for now). I will try to implement all of this in the future.
## Purpose:
The purpose of creating this type of neural network is to give a neural nets a chance to hardly compete and/or even overcome regular gradient-boosted decision forests. Currently, in my company we have a large tabular datasets with tons of categorical things to make embeddings from. 
### Todos:
* Finish the project and make it more universal
* Implement workspace with embeddings
* Dive into "rocket science" (implementing abstract layers)
